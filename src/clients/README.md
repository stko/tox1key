# Examples
There are no dedicated  client or examples yet, as the whole functionality is actual for development purposes still included in the `/src/tox1key/python/tox1key.py library` itself

You can run it by change into that directory and 

    python Tox1Key.py --name=user1 [--door]

where the name is used to store all settings and data assigned to that account. If no data exists, a new tox-Id is generated.

When the flag --door is set, the program acts as a door, otherways as a normal user.


## The Data files

### *.json
These files contain the own given permissions and the permissions given to others and will be generated by the program itself

### *.data
These files contain the binary data of the Tox- Account and will be generated by the program itself. To start from scratch again, delete these files, otherways better don't touch this ;-)


### *.masters
These files are only used for the doors. They need to be created by the user before the first start. They contain the Tox public keys of the users who have full access over the doors.
